      "context": "The history of bread-making dates back thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians are credited with developing leavened bread around 4000 BCE. The process was discovered accidentally when wild yeast landed on dough left out in the warm Egyptian climate.\n\nButterflies taste with their feet. When a butterfly lands on a plant, special chemoreceptors on their feet help them determine if the plant is suitable for laying eggs or if it contains nectar worth drinking.\n\nThe world's oldest known recipe is for beer. Dating back to around 1800 BCE, the recipe was found on a Sumerian tablet and describes a detailed brewing process using barley and dates.\n\nOctopuses have three hearts and blue blood. Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Their blood is blue because it uses copper-based hemocyanin instead of iron-based hemoglobin.\n\nThe shortest war in history lasted only 38 to 45 minutes. The Anglo-Zanzibar War occurred on August 27, 1896, between the United Kingdom and the Zanzibar Sultanate.\n\nHoney never spoils. Archaeologists have found 3,000-year-old honey in Egyptian tombs that was still perfectly edible. Honey's low moisture content and acidic pH create an inhospitable environment for bacteria.\n\nA group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance'. These pink birds get their color from the carotenoid pigments in the algae and crustaceans they eat.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower can grow more than 6 inches during the summer. The iron structure expands when heated, making the tower measurably taller on hot days.\n\nBananas are berries, but strawberries are not. Botanically speaking, a berry develops from a single flower with one ovary, which applies to bananas but not to strawberries.\n\nVenus is the only planet that spins clockwise. All other planets in our solar system rotate counter-clockwise when viewed from above their north poles.\n\nThe inventor of the Pringles can is buried in one. Fredric Baur designed the iconic cylindrical container and requested that some of his ashes be buried in a Pringles can.\n\nScotland's national animal is the unicorn. The mythical creature has been a Scottish heraldic symbol since the 12th century.\n\nA jiffy is an actual unit of time. In physics, it represents the time it takes light to travel one centimeter, approximately 33.3564 picoseconds.\n\nThe Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. This popular myth has been debunked by astronauts, as the wall is too narrow to be distinguished from orbit.\n\nCows have best friends and become stressed when separated from them.

The process was discovered accidentally when wild yeast landed on dough left out in the warm Egyptian climate.\n\nButterflies taste with their feet. When a butterfly lands on a plant, special chemoreceptors on their feet help them determine if the plant is suitable for laying eggs or if it contains nectar worth drinking.\n\nThe world's oldest known recipe is for beer. Dating back to around 1800 BCE, the recipe was found on a Sumerian tablet and describes a detailed brewing process using barley and dates.\n\nOctopuses have three hearts and blue blood. Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Their blood is blue because it uses copper-based hemocyanin instead of iron-based hemoglobin.\n\nThe shortest war in history lasted only 38 to 45 minutes. The Anglo-Zanzibar War occurred on August 27, 1896, between the United Kingdom and the Zanzibar Sultanate.\n\nHoney never spoils. Archaeologists have found 3,000-year-old honey in Egyptian tombs that was still perfectly edible. Honey's low moisture content and acidic pH create an inhospitable environment for bacteria.\n\nA group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance'. These pink birds get their color from the carotenoid pigments in the algae and crustaceans they eat.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower can grow more than 6 inches during the summer. The iron structure expands when heated, making the tower measurably taller on hot days.\n\nBananas are berries, but strawberries are not. Botanically speaking, a berry develops from a single flower with one ovary, which applies to bananas but not to strawberries.\n\nVenus is the only planet that spins clockwise. All other planets in our solar system rotate counter-clockwise when viewed from above their north poles.\n\nThe inventor of the Pringles can is buried in one. Fredric Baur designed the iconic cylindrical container and requested that some of his ashes be buried in a Pringles can.\n\nScotland's national animal is the unicorn. The mythical creature has been a Scottish heraldic symbol since the 12th century.\n\nA jiffy is an actual unit of time. In physics, it represents the time it takes light to travel one centimeter, approximately 33.3564 picoseconds.\n\nThe Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. This popular myth has been debunked by astronauts, as the wall is too narrow to be distinguished from orbit.\n\nCows have best friends and become stressed when separated from them.

The mythical creature has been a Scottish heraldic symbol since the 12th century.\n\nA jiffy is an actual unit of time. In physics, it represents the time it takes light to travel one centimeter, approximately 33.3564 picoseconds.\n\nThe Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. This popular myth has been debunked by astronauts, as the wall is too narrow to be distinguished from orbit.\n\nCows have best friends and become stressed when separated from them. Research has shown that cows are social animals that form strong bonds with herd members.\n\nThe history of bread-making dates back thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians are credited with developing leavened bread around 4000 BCE. The process was discovered accidentally when wild yeast landed on dough left out in the warm Egyptian climate.\n\nButterflies taste with their feet. When a butterfly lands on a plant, special chemoreceptors on their feet help them determine if the plant is suitable for laying eggs or if it contains nectar worth drinking.\n\nThe world's oldest known recipe is for beer. Dating back to around 1800 BCE, the recipe was found on a Sumerian tablet and describes a detailed brewing process using barley and dates.\n\nOctopuses have three hearts and blue blood. Two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Their blood is blue because it uses copper-based hemocyanin instead of iron-based hemoglobin.\n\nThe shortest war in history lasted only 38 to 45 minutes. The Anglo-Zanzibar War occurred on August 27, 1896, between the United Kingdom and the Zanzibar Sultanate.\n\nHoney never spoils. Archaeologists have found 3,000-year-old honey in Egyptian tombs that was still perfectly edible. Honey's low moisture content and acidic pH create an inhospitable environment for bacteria.\n\nA group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance'. These pink birds get their color from the carotenoid pigments in the algae and crustaceans they eat.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower can grow more than 6 inches during the summer. The iron structure expands when heated, making the tower measurably taller on hot days.\n\nBananas are berries, but strawberries are not. Botanically speaking, a berry develops from a single flower with one ovary, which applies to bananas but not to strawberries.\n\nVenus is the only planet that spins clockwise. All other planets in our solar system rotate counter-clockwise when viewed from above their north poles.\n\nThe inventor of the Pringles can is buried in one.
